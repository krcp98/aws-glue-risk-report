# ðŸ“Š Risk Report Generator using PySpark

This project demonstrates how to build a **data transformation pipeline using PySpark**, designed to run on AWS Glue or locally for testing. The script reads raw user risk data, applies masking, formatting, and validation logic, and generates a clean risk report with logs.

- âœ… Validate Indian PIN codes (6-digit only)
- âœ… Clean up nulls and standardize fields
- âœ… Modular, log-enabled PySpark script

## ðŸ§° Tech Stack

- Python 3.8+
- PySpark 3.4.x
- AWS Glue (for production)
- Local development with logging
